# Scam-punishment
Made a python script which punishes the scammer PS: it worked!

# How it started
I got an sms telling me to take free loan from this website, I knew it was a scam so I opened the website and found it pretty broke.
I opened the webite on laptop, the website structure was broked up so it was easy to skip the otp verification part which was 
ofcourse fake
I downloaded html pages which you can see in the directory and the post method was not so secured.

# How punishing script works!
the python scripts basically post the information which is required on that particular page at a fast rate, which will crash their server or their
storage will fill up . So at one page they were asking my pan card details for which i made a special python script which will provide them pan card:)

# End results
I ran the script for straight 5 hours and gived up because nothing was changing , I left my laptop at my table and after 30 mins I came to check and 
hell yeah the website was down. And it is still down . I cant mention the website here, but you can find that in my python file, enjoy!

# Warning
dont use this script for illegal purposes, only mess with scammers and sinners, good luck! :)
